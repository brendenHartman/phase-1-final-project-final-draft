#Coin Catalog

Coin Catalog is a single page application that takes cryptocurrency data from an online API, and creats visual cards for you to view and sort. 


##Usage

Chose your desired amount of crypto's to load and hit create. This will load that amount of cards with corresponding currencies onto the page. From here, you can chose to sort or reset. Sorting allows you to sort the cards that you have loaded alphabetically, by increasing coin value, and by increasing change in price over the last 24hr. Resetting allows you to chose a different amount of cards to load If you feel like you want to see more currencies. You can always cancel, and later undo this function. At any time you can remove individual cards as well, using the red remove button on the card.

##Contributing

This project is not open to peer contribution at this time.

##Visuals

Below you can see screenshots of the application during the start screen, once the cards have been loaded, and another screenshot using the sort bar to sort alphabetically.
